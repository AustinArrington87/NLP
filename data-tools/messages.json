The developers of Riverfront at #WestHyattsville Metro, a joint project of @gilbanedevelopment and the Hogan Companies, founded by @larryhogan, plan to buy the additional land from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority this spring, according to the @wbjnewsroom. Staff from WMATA @metroforward said the developers would be the only ones who could make use of the property, which is surrounded by the Northwest Branch Trail of the Anacostia River, the Green Line and the planned Riverfront development. The Riverfront project was expected to feature 183 townhomes, 300 apartments, 9,000 square feet of retail and a 4.5 acre recreation area before the added land.

In short it is an indicator of how strong and pest resistant a plant will be and, importantly for us, how flavourful our food will be.\nFlavour then, vis a vis, is an indicator of how nutrition rich the food is. We all enjoy real tasting flavourful fruits and vegetables instead of the bland and insipid flavour it usually is from the supermarket.\nWell, now you know that flavour corresponds with the vitamin and mineral content of a food as the latter are locked up in the sugar/starch/cellulose complexes in the plant.\nWhen you are eating conventionally grown foods, laced with pesticides grown in nutritionally poor and dying soils, bred and artificially fed for size, water content for weight, robustness for global travel and picked unripe to survive the journey, is it any wonder these foods don’t taste that great?  It’s no wonder we want to cook or process the little remaining vitality out of them and add fats, sugar, salt, and spices to give us any taste satisfaction. But we aren’t getting any real nutritional satisfaction either.\nWhen you eat foods, particularly homegrown, in well-built soils, free of poisonous influences, you taste the difference. You feel the difference inside of you if you pay attention. When you discover and experience this for yourself and realize that not only are you depriving your taste buds of any real adventure, but your body and brain of real nutrition too, you stop compromising on quality.\nWe pump foods up on water for weight with artificial fertilizer salts for commerce...for profit...not for health. As Geoff Lawton said, “If our food was valued by its refractive index and not by weight, how we all grew it would change very quickly across the planet.” Such practices don’t feed the soil so they can’t feed your plants, which in turn can’t feed you. How much longer will you deprive yourself of high-quality nutrition? How much do you think you are worth it?

method to transition from summer to fall/winter crops is to perform it in stages. For instance, the center beds of the high tunnel may still have productive trellised tomatoes in September, whereas the edge beds may have grown an earlier crop of cucumbers or summer squash now at the end of the productive phase. ⠀\n⠀\nFor an unheated or ‘Cold’ tunnel, these former cucumber/squash beds would be selected to be re-planted with the longer maturing fall/winter crops such as fresh winter carrots, kale, chard, scallions, or even direct seeded with a fall crop of spinach. Then, once the tomatoes have finished producing at the beginning of October, the empty beds can be direct seeded with faster maturing salad greens like baby leaf lettuce or transplanted with two-week old spinach seedlings. ⠀\n⠀\nWith the additional protection of an inner row cover over low tunnel hoops, these crops would then be harvestable around the end of November and then weekly throughout the winter depending on the severity of the weather conditions and its effect on regrowth for ‘cut-and-come-again’ crops.⠀\n⠀\n#RimolGreenhouse #FourSeasonFarming #growthroughsnow #winterready #tough #durabl;e #reliable #RImol #greenhouse #greenhousegrowing #togetherwegrow #winterprep", "media_share_url": "https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/22352537_333920850404251_4786669308258287616_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=JJ3MpyQvmrUAX85ELpI&_nc_tp=18&oh=dc6ae06fcda385fbf20abb6ee454e3e9&oe=5F51CC60&ig_cache_key=MTYyMzk2ODk0MjkyMDI3NjY0NQ%3D%3D.2"}, {"sender": "bb.arrington", "created_at": "2020-05-28T19:12:02.152726+00:00", "story_share": "Shared plant_group's story", "text": "👏"}, {"sender": "plant_group", "created_at": "2020-05-26T21:34:56.003071+00:00", "likes": [{"username": "bb.arrington", "date": "2020-05-26T21:38:42.036762+00:00"}], "media_owner": "allthebloom", "media_share_caption": "PLANTS teach ✨ P A T I E N C E ✨⁣⁣ 🤷🏽‍♀️\n⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\n⁣\n⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣🌿 Visit our online GARDEN⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣ALLTHEBLOOM.COM | Just Bloom!®️🌸⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣#plantvibes #vibes #biophilia #biophilicdesign #create #art #plantcareisselfcare #plants #succulents #propagation #plantsmakepeoplehappy #grow #roots #bloom #g🌸ᗩ🌹ᖇ🥀ᗪ🌼e🌺ᑎ #yogi", "media_share_url": "https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/100996757_917734008648838_828933602151858629_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=Q_LzhOntXwEAX_ADHpM&_nc_tp=18&oh=fc0bbb68055b77e54df8cbe5c83d69b3&oe=5F4FF32D&ig_cache_key=MjMxNzY2MDc1MTg4NzAwMjkxNg%3D%3D.2"}, {"sender": "plant_group", "created_at": "2020-05-26T01:49:37.297100+00:00", "likes": [{"username": "bb.arrington", "date": "2020-05-26T01:49:54.652881+00:00"}], "media_owner": "growsomethinggreen", "media_share_caption": "TRUTH!!!! 📷 via Reddit user u/123starlings\n\n#gardening #garden #creativegardening #growsomethinggreen #mothernature", "media_share_url": "https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/p1080x1080/101002952_335623580752124_3954011345076920189_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=47ACno0Wlx4AX8t2Mf0&oh=3a764eebfde178c3d6070c742a013c45&oe=5F5111D1&ig_cache_key=MjMxNjk2ODk5Mjc4NjMxMDY5Ng%3D%3D.2"}, {"sender": "bb.arrington", "created_at": "2020-05-22T17:02:18.612825+00:00", "story_share": "Shared plant_group's story", "text": "😂"}, {"sender": "bb.arrington", "created_at": "2020-04-15T15:42:53.010464+00:00", "likes": [{"username": "bb.arrington", "date": "2020-04-24T20:49:01.346277+00:00"}], "profile_share_username": "lettucegrow", "profile_share_name": "Lettuce Grow"}, {"sender": "plant_group", "created_at": "2020-04-15T14:13:34.356021+00:00", "media_owner": "firstnaturedesign", "media_share_caption": "This is what it looks like to grow 85% of one person’s yearly food needs. @liz_zorab_byther_farm grows it all on less then an acre of land.

But that small plot produced more than they could eat. Not wanting all the herbs, lemons, and beans to go to waste, Jamiah posted on Nextdoor to gauge his neighbors' interest in a crop swap. The turnout was substantial.

In short it is an indicator of how strong and pest resistant a plant will be and, importantly for us, how flavourful our food will be.\nFlavour then, vis a vis, is an indicator of how nutrition rich the food is. We all enjoy real tasting flavourful fruits and vegetables instead of the bland and insipid flavour it usually is from the supermarket.\nWell, now you know that flavour corresponds with the vitamin and mineral content of a food as the latter are locked up in the sugar/starch/cellulose complexes in the plant.\nWhen you are eating conventionally grown foods, laced with pesticides grown in nutritionally poor and dying soils, bred and artificially fed for size, water content for weight, robustness for global travel and picked unripe to survive the journey, is it any wonder these foods don’t taste that great?  It’s no wonder we want to cook or process the little remaining vitality out of them and add fats, sugar, salt, and spices to give us any taste satisfaction. But we aren’t getting any real nutritional satisfaction either.\nWhen you eat foods, particularly homegrown, in well-built soils, free of poisonous influences, you taste the difference. You feel the difference inside of you if you pay attention. When you discover and experience this for yourself and realize that not only are you depriving your taste buds of any real adventure, but your body and brain of real nutrition too, you stop compromising on quality.\nWe pump foods up on water for weight with artificial fertilizer salts for commerce...for profit...not for health. As Geoff Lawton said, “If our food was valued by its refractive index and not by weight, how we all grew it would change very quickly across the planet.” Such practices don’t feed the soil so they can’t feed your plants, which in turn can’t feed you. How much longer will you deprive yourself of high-quality nutrition? How much do you think you are worth it?

You should therefore aerate the soil occasionally because there are no worms inside your house plant soil. Soil structure matters! (more on this in the link in my profile)\n▪️Soil drainage and saturation: see how \"excess\" water escapes from being absorbed by the soil as it pools into the dish below. But as the video speeds up - notice how that pool is sucked up into the soil. Thus, the soil was not yet at saturation because it had the capacity to take in more water - was no excess water here. For most tropical foliage plants, when they need water, you should bring the soil to saturation. Think of the jungle: \"when it rains, it pours!\"\n▪️Afraid of overwatering? I know you thought of this after reading the previous point. If you did, you probably also think that soil just \"dries out\" in a passive manner. Fact: the majority of the soil becomes dry because the plant uses up the moisture - evaporation only affects the top inch of soil. The plant only takes in the water deeper in the soil when it is photosynthesizing in the right light. So, the counter example is this: if you put your plant in a decorative position that is far from any windows or has a limited view of the sky, it will not be photosynthesizing as quickly, which means the soil will stay moist for longer, which increases the risk of root rot.\n~\n~\n#timelapse #houseplants #houseplantjournal #observe #plants #science #botany #horticulture #gardening #botanical #greenthumb #plantlife #plantlove #plantcare #wisdom #stayhydrated", "media_share_url": "https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/27061416_684950478559285_6857511974985531392_n.mp4?efg=eyJxZV9ncm91cHMiOiJbXCJpZ19wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZV91cmxnZW4ucHJvZHVjdF90eXBlLmZlZWRcIl0ifQ&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=-CvD3aO9wJYAX8MsZCo&oe=5F291334&oh=e950774617245413f88ff887afcaa950"}, {"sender": "plant_group", "created_at": "2017-11-04T15:23:26.004659+00:00", "media_owner": "houseplantjournal", "media_share_caption": "Terracotta party featuring (largest to smallest): money tree (Pachira aquatica), baby ponytail palms (Beaucarnea recurvata), and Albuca sp.

Capybara are on constant alert and are never far from their emergency exit- the river. Whenever they sense danger, they let out a loud bark (to alert their family group) before launching in!

Sensible cooling counteracts heat gain (lights, motors, DH) and latent cooling removes humidity. The objective is to minimize energy used to accomplish desired room temperature and relative humidity. When air is cooled, relative humidity goes up. The more air is cooled, the higher relative humidity goes. If cooled enough (below dewpoint), water condenses and falls out of the air. Air conditioners cool room air by about 15 to 20°F. In damp rooms (80% RH) lots of water condenses and air-conditioners provide both heat and water removal. Humidifiers are needed to maintain high humidity during lights-on. A thin (two row) evaporator coil in the air handler would remove less water, providing a higher SHR (sensible heat ratio). This would reduce the need for humidifiers. In dry rooms (50% RH) little water is condensed by air conditioners. Dry room air must be cooled a full 20° before condensing begins to occur. The air-conditioner now delivers mainly sensible cooling, all temperature drop and little humidity removal. Plants are still transpiring so dehumidifiers are needed to remove the moisture. Stand alone (plug-in) dehumidifiers have cooling coils and a compressor built into one cabinet. As one coil cools room air to condense water, a second coil rejects heat developed by the compressor. The result yields warm, dry air. During lights-on additional air-conditioning and energy use is needed to remove dehumidifier heat. At night, some heat is needed to counteract transpirational cooling. Each pint of water transpired creates 1000 BTUs of cooling to the plant. If 20 pints transpire in one hour, 20,000 BTUs of heat must be added to the room to maintain steady temperature.", "media_share_url": "https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/57298002_872088246465298_3521641433072540254_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=7IKRhoTt0ekAX8xpiOO&_nc_tp=18&oh=cba810272c73c901daa9726012d644c2&oe=5F4E643D&ig_cache_key=MjAzNjUxMTUyNTg3MDc3NTAzNg%3D%3D.2"}, {"sender": "iamstefan", "created_at": "2019-04-26T05:02:58.511498+00:00", "media_owner": "twincreekspc", "media_share_caption": "A little progress on this Pavestone wall this week.

Thanks to @growru for the detailed post. REPOST: growruOverview:\nHere is a quick rundown on how to take a sap sample and then check the brix and ph of the plant sap. You can use ph test strips or a horiba la aqua ph pen to test a few drops of sap. Horiba also makes meters for Ca, K, N03, Na, EC that way can take samples and do testing in the field or gh. In an ideal situation we would send samples to a lab and get an analysis on all the elements. But since this is not available everywhere for now for cannabis we can use handheld meters. Sap press, paper ph test strips and Refractometer is the bare minimum to get started for the least cost. Next up, I would get the ph, then potassium meter and then optionally calcium, sodium and nitrate.\n\nHow:\nGet a piece of paper and a pen. \nNote the time and date. I then take a lower and upper leaf sample. Take the test at the same time every day. A few hours after sunup or lights on. \n1. All the tools lined up. Top is vice grips, then there is a ph, calcium and potassium and bottom is refractometer, which is used to test brix. \n2. Take a leaf. Remove petiole.\n3. Put into vice grips for pressing sap. \n4. Squeeze sap into a horiba ph meter. Take reading. Continue for Ca, K, etc if you got those. Dont worry if you dont, ph and brix is good for now.\n5. Pour that sap into the refractometer, hold up to the light and then take the brix reading.\n\nNote your measurements for lower and upper leaves. \nLow pH + Moderate Brix = Calcium Deficiency\nLow pH + Low Brix = Potassium Deficiency\n6.4 pH + High Brix = Balance\n\nAbove 12 is considered High Brix. \nGenerally, the more mature leaves on the plant will give the most accurate picture of the plant’s health, level of resistance or susceptibility to problems. Since the plant spends most of its energy supporting new growth, the pH of new leaves will not reflect the pH of the rest of the plant as a whole. Sap and brix test can also be used to test the plant response of a mineral or microbial application. \nWant to learn more via one on one training for you and or your team?

The answers were all over the place, many were wrong but it’s not so much that they were incorrect but how enthusiastic and passionate so many of the incorrect answers were. Either way, here’s the answer and as promised I’ll give my $0.02 as to why it might matter to anyone working with Uponor tubing .\n.\n\nThis is about @uponorna and Sioux Chief. Not any other brand or system. And it’s just me talking about it, no one is paying me for this, I just hope it’s helpful .\n.\n\nThe bottom, thinner-walled fitting with the more dramatic “barb” is from Uponor. The top fitting is relatively new to the market and sold through retail outlets and some supply houses. Both are made from and engineered polymer. If you want technical specs on either just visit the respective websites .\n.\n\nI cannot comment on whether one is “better” than the other. I can say without a doubt that mixing the two severely effects the Uponor warranty coverage, but it does not immediately void the warranty as a lot of people in the industry think and often say .\n.\n\nUponor’s warranty (partially included, swipe) is as a “system” 25 years. Sioux chief’s warranty is less explicit in what I have found available online but is also 25 years.  Uponor clearly states that a “system” constitutes the use of only Uponor branded tubing, fittings and components. As soon as a component of another manufacturer is installed the warranty coverage period is significantly less .\n.\n\nSo why does this matter? If you’re selling the product as one that’s covered for 25 years from the manufacturer but you use non-Uponor products in that system, you’re likely liable for repairs at some point and will not have the support you could have. It’s my opinion that the relatively small amount of possible savings from using a lower cost fitting now is unimportant. It’s also important to know if the product you’re buying is going to negate warranty period coverage and sold otherwise. I think it’s important to do your homework and know what you’re buying and offering.

Both are great but one is superior in just a few key ways .\n\nFirst I believe the cold expansion fitting system is better. There are fewer opportunities to make mistakes. Second is the ability to repair damaged tubing (i.e. kink in the line) without the need for fittings. That last one is great because it’s not only a less expensive repair but can be done anywhere on the tubing, even if the tubing will be embedded in concrete (radiant system) .\n\nThe other part of this pic that gets me going is the fact we can make this type of repair with a cordless tool. The cordless heat gun isn’t a niche tool, it’s very useful for many different applications. As long as you know it’s limits it’s seriously handy to have in the arsenal. I wonder why other companies haven’t followed up with their own cordless heat gun?

Noisy pipes, valves, and other air-related noises are often accepted as the signs of a functioning system. Excessive pump noise, cavitation, and cascading in terminal units are considered normal. Air in system water can cause corrosion, reduced efficiency, poorly heated rooms, accelerated component wear and on-going complaints. Unlike conventional air eliminators or air scoops, the Spirovent completely eliminates 100% of the free air, 100% of the entrained air, and up to 99.6% of the dissolved air in the system. Consisting of woven copper wire soldered to a copper tube, the patented Spirotube® creates a low velocity area in the Spirovent that scrubs the bubbles from the water. The air bubbles rise and collect in the air chamber before they are vented from the system via an integral automatic valve. Ideal placement of the Spirovent is based on microbubble separation and Henry’s Law*. Simply put, Henry’s Law states that air is released from water as the temperature increases or the pressure decreases. In hydronic heating systems, the Spirovent should be installed in the boiler supply line where the temperature is highest. Should the circulator be located on the supply line as well, the Spirovent should be installed between the boiler and the circulator.", "media_share_url": "https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/60325464_356687545202386_2892439528836965722_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=JG2v1bupYrgAX8mMMJX&_nc_tp=18&oh=413072be7fe9c2c05e363f68ca0e20aa&oe=5F50CAA0&ig_cache_key=MjA0NzU3NjU3ODA0OTY4OTIxMQ%3D%3D.2"}, {"sender": "modphymech", "created_at": "2019-05-20T01:08:45.835442+00:00", "story_share": "Shared swoozycruz's story", "text": "", "story_share_type": "default"}, {"sender": "modphymech", "created_at": "2019-05-05T02:15:45.778497+00:00", "media_owner": "pipefitter71", "media_share_caption": "Follow up vid.

This also helps cut down on vegetables and fruits that require a lot of time with prep before sale. 🍅\n.\nThe list includes heritage non-GMO popping corn, winter squash, dried beans, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and summer squash. 😋\n.\nThese plants also lend themselves to fantastic permaculture set-ups on the farm. We utilize companion planting to the max to help plants carve out their ideal growing environment. The three sisters garden is the best example. 🤓\n.\nCorn, the first sister, is planted in blocks about 20x20'. We do both dent corn and popping corn. The Oaxacan variety from @bakercreekseeds has done exceptionally well on our land, so we keep planting it for cornmeal and treating our hens. We are trying a heritage black and strawberry popcorn this year from @seed_savers_exchange and are excited to see how it does. 🌽\n.\nThen winter squash, the second sister, is planted along the perimeter. The squash's big leaves shade the soil to slow the loss of moisture, so thirsty corn gets enough water and keeps weeds at bay. 🎃 .\nFinally, the third sister is pole beans, which we plant at the base of every corn stalk once it hits 1’ tall. The beans climb the corn stalks for support and in turn act as nitrogen fixers, fertilizing our soil for free. ⏬\n.\nCome September, we will be swimming in crops that store through the winter like total champs. Dried beans for chilis and stews, popcorn for late night munching, and all kinds of winter squash for wholesome cold weather meals. 🥘\n.\nDoes anybody else try three sisters gardens on their farm?

The world's largest rodent, the capybara, is also near the top of the menu. But looking like a giant ginea pig, you might think they're sitting ducks. Far from it.
